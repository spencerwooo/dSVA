Boosting Generative Adversarial Transferability with Self-supervised Vision Transformer Features

_**Shangbo Wu**, Yu-an Tan, Ruinan Ma, Wencong Ma, Dehua Zhu, Yuanzhang Li^_

## TL;DR

We present dSVA, a generative dual self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits <ins>dual self-supervised ViT features</ins> -- both from <ins>contrastive learning (e.g., DINO)</ins> and <ins>masked image modeling (e.g., MAE)</ins> -- to achieve remarkable black-box adversarial transferability, outperforming state-of-the-arts.
